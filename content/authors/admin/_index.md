I'm tenure-track faculty at [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/), [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/). Before that, I was previously a research scientist at [Baidu Research](http://research.baidu.com/). I obtained the PhD degree from [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://en.nwpu.edu.cn/) in 2019, supervised by [Xuelong Li](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=ahUibskAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), [Xiaoqiang Lu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=FRyuu2IAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), and [Feiping Nie](http://www.escience.cn/people/fpnie/index.html). What I met, told and learned in the Center for OPTical IMagery Analysis and Learning (OPTIMAL) led by Prof. [Xuelong Li](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=ahUibskAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) have undoubtedly made great impacts on me. Great Thanks!
Currently, I'm leading the [GeWu Lab](https://dtaoo.github.io/group.html) and exploring how to understand and interact with the world via the natural multimodal messages. I'm strongly convinced that the pervasive and free correspondence between multimodal messages can provide sufficient information for perceiving, learning and understanding environment, even the agent itself, which promisingly makes multimodal perception become one of the key to achieve machine intelligence.
