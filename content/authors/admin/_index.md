Di Hu is tenure-track faculty at [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/), [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/). Before that, he was previously a research scientist at [Baidu Research](http://research.baidu.com/). Di Hu obtained the Ph.D degree from [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://en.nwpu.edu.cn/) in 2019, supervised by [Xuelong Li](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=ahUibskAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). Currently, Di Hu is leading the [GeWu Lab](https://dtaoo.github.io/group.html) and exploring how to understand and interact with the world via the natural multimodal messages. He is an aficionado of cognitive neuroscience and has wrote one study [note](https://dtaoo.github.io/papers/cognitiveScience.pdf) during his undergraduate. Inspired by what he learned from cognitive neuroscience, and what he observed and deliberated from the daily-life, he strongly convinced that the pervasive, free, natural multimodal messages can provide sufficient information for perceiving, learning and understanding environment, even the agent itself, which promisingly makes multimodal learning become one of the key to achieve machine intelligence.
