From 2021 to 2022, I have been spending a wonderful period of time at [GeWu Lab](https://dtaoo.github.io/group.html), working with Dr. [Di Hu](https://dtaoo.github.io/) , who is really a passionate and respectful young scholar and I learned a lot from him. I have also worked as a deep learning research intern at Big Data Lab, Baidu, working with Dr. [Xingjian Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=f9V0NZkAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. [Dejing Dou](https://ix.cs.uoregon.edu/~dou/). Prior to that, I obtained my Master degree from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2021, and worked as a research assistant advised by Dr. [Weiwei Cai](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/teacher_directory1/caiweiwei.html).
