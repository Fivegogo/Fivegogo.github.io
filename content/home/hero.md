GeWu Lab focus to make machine perceive and understand the world as human with multi-sensory knowledge. Gewu is taken from [The Great Learning](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%A4%BC%E8%AE%B0), which means we want to pursue the very source of knowledge with the multi-sensory machine learning and do the down-to-earth research to make contribution to social development.
