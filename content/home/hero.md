GeWu-Lab is a research group focusing on how to make the machine perceive and understand the world as our humans, especially with multimodal messages, such as vision, sound, tactile etc. GeWu (“格物” in Chinese) is taken from [Book of Rites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Rites), which implies that we aim to equip the machine with the ability of learning from multiple modalities, under the direction of doing valuable contribution to the community and society. If you are interested in our lab, you can learn more via the following ways.
