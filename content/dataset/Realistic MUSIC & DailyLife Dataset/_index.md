title: Realistic MUSIC & DailyLife dataset
summary: To further evaluate our model in real-world scenes, we collect real multi-source instrument videos and real multi-source daily life scenes on YouTube. Each instrument video includes 3 to 4 instruments and each daily life scene includes 2 events Because of the high noise of the real data, we perform manual labeling for bounding box annotation.
