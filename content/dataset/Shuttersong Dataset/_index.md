Shuttersong Dataset contains amounts of pairwise images and songs (lyrics) collected from the Shuttersong application. [Shuttersong](https://dtaoo.github.io/www.shuttersong.com) is a social sharing software, just like Instagram2. However, the shared content contains not only an image, but also a corresponding song clip selected by users, which is for strengthening the expression purpose. A relevant mood can also be appended by users. We collect almost the entire updated data from Shuttersong, which consists of 36,646 pairs of images and song clips. Some optional mood and favorite count information are also included. For more details about this dataset, please refer to [our paper](https://dtaoo.github.io/papers/2017_image2song.pdf).
