AuDio Visual Aerial sceNe reCognition datasEt (ADVANCE) consists of 5,075 geotagged aerial imagesound pairs involving 13 scene classes. The audio data are collected from [Freesound](https://freesound.org/browse/geotags/), where we remove the audio recordings that are shorter than 2 seconds, and extend those that are between 2 and 10 seconds to longer than 10 seconds by replicating the audio content. From the location information, we can download the updated aerial images from [Google Earth](https://earthengine.google.com/). Finally, the paired data are labeled according to the annotations from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), also using the attached geographic coordinates from the audio recording. Note that, this dataset covers a large variety of scenes from across the world. For more details about this dataset, please refer to [our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.08449.pdf).
