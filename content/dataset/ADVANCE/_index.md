summary: To our knowledge, the audiovisual aerial scene recognition task has not been explored before. For further facilitating the research in this field, we construct a new dataset, with high-quality images and scene labels, named as ADVANCE, which in summary contains 5075 pairs of aerial images and sounds, classified into 13 classes.

AuDio Visual Aerial sceNe reCognition datasEt (ADVANCE) consists of 5,075 geotagged aerial imagesound pairs involving 13 scene classes. The audio data are collected from [Freesound](https://freesound.org/browse/geotags/), where we remove the audio recordings that are shorter than 2 seconds, and extend those that are between 2 and 10 seconds to longer than 10 seconds by replicating the audio content. From the location information, we can download the updated aerial images from [Google Earth](https://earthengine.google.com/). Finally, the paired data are labeled according to the annotations from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), also using the attached geographic coordinates from the audio recording. Note that, this dataset covers a large variety of scenes from across the world. For more details about this dataset, please refer to [our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.08449.pdf).
