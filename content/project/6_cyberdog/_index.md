Audio-Visual Navigation requires embodied agents to move around and reach the goal point in a 3D environment. Despite some research in the field, there's a lack of work on the deployment. We aims to migrate the model to Mi CyberDog and narrow the gaps between real environment and the simulation one.

The project is planned in three phases:

- Emotional Perception of Multimodal Scenarios
- Model Design and Training on Simulation Platforms
- Model Deployment and Gap Narrowing
